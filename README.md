Got it ✅ — here’s a comprehensive README.md for your Fantasy Premier League ML project, in full markdown script so you can paste it directly:

# FPL-ML: Fantasy Premier League Machine Learning Pipeline

A machine learning and optimization pipeline for **Fantasy Premier League (FPL)** that predicts weekly player performance and recommends the **optimal squad** for each gameweek.

This project ingests real FPL data, engineers features, trains predictive models, and selects squads based on expected performance — automating the weekly decision-making process.

## ⚙️ Pipeline Workflow

Each gameweek follows the same steps:

1. **Ingest Data** – Fetch the real FPL results of the previous GW  
2. **Update Features** – Update the dataset with the new results  
3. **Train Model** – Retrain ML model using data up to the current GW  
4. **Predict Next GW** – Predict player scores for the next GW  
5. **Optimize Squad** – Select the best 15-player squad for the upcoming GW

## 🚀 Weekly Workflow Example (Gameweek 3)

Run these commands one after another to produce the **GW3 optimal squad**.  
(Replace `2`/`3` with your real gameweek numbers.)

```bash
# 1) Fetch GW2 real results
python src/ingest/fetch_gw.py --gw 2

# 2) Update features using GW2
python src/features/update_features_weekly.py --gw 2

# 3) Retrain model using data up to GW2 (train on GW < 3)
python src/models/train_model_weekly.py --target_gw 3

# 4) Predict GW3
python src/models/predict_next_gw.py --target_gw 3

# 5) Optimize/select squad for GW3
python src/optimization/select_squad.py --pred data/predictions/predictions_gw3.csv

👉 After this, you will have:
	•	Predictions file: data/predictions/predictions_gw3.csv
	•	Optimal Squad file: data/predictions/optimal_squad.csv (or saved per GW if extended)

🧠 Machine Learning Details
	•	Features Engineered:
	•	Player past performance (form, minutes, goals, assists, clean sheets)
	•	Team strength indicators
	•	Opponent difficulty
	•	Rolling averages and exponential moving averages
	•	Models:
	•	Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost/LightGBM)
	•	Linear models for baselines
	•	Weekly retraining for adaptive learning
	•	Target Variable: Expected FPL points in next GW

⸻

🏆 Optimization (Squad Selection)
	•	Constraints:
	•	15 players (2 GKs, 5 DEF, 5 MID, 3 FWD)
	•	Max 3 players per real team
	•	Budget cap (100.0 FPL budget)
	•	Method: Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to maximize total predicted points.

⸻

📊 Outputs
	•	Predicted scores per player per GW (data/predictions/predictions_gwX.csv)
	•	Optimal squad for the upcoming GW (data/predictions/optimal_squad.csv)

Example (GW3 optimal squad):

Position	Player	Team	Predicted Points
GK	Player A	TOT	4.3
DEF	Player B	MCI	6.1
DEF	Player C	CHE	5.4
…	…	…	…
FWD	Player O	ARS	7.8

🛠️ Installation

# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/kyupralis24/fpl-ml.git
cd fpl-ml

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

✅ Weekly Checklist

At the end of every GW:
	1.	Fetch the last GW results
	2.	Update features
	3.	Retrain the model (target = next GW)
	4.	Predict next GW player scores
	5.	Run squad optimization

⸻

📌 Future Improvements
	•	Save optimal squads per GW automatically (optimal_squad_gwX.csv)
	•	Add transfer logic across weeks
	•	Explore deep learning models for prediction
	•	Incorporate expected goals (xG/xA) data
